# What is Savemycode?
SaveMyCode was my mini project during second year of bachelor's degree.
I thought it would be tremendously useful. Sadly, it is not. You can poke around the code,
and I would be delighted, if you find something useful...

# What I wrote about it originally
SaveMyCode! is a backup utility for programmers.
It monitors the directories you choose for any change in files.
If changes are found, the whole directory is compressed and backed up.

What makes SaveMyCode! special is that, when changes occur, it does not OVERWRITE the older backup,
rather the new file is stored with timestamp prefixed to it's name.
The advantage is clear, you can mess with your code without worrying about data loss.
Coded a hideous bug in place of a reliable block of code? just restore the older source code.

The program is still in alpha stage. It is working, but a bit buggy.
There is not even a proper installer (I am figuring that out...)
But for now, test drive the program and enjoy it :)
